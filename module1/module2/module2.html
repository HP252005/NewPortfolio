        <h3> AD, or Computer-Aided Design, is a technology that utilizes software to create, modify, 
            analyze, or optimize designs for various industries such as engineering, architecture, 
            automotive, aerospace, and more. CAD software often supports parametric modeling, where 
            designs are created using parameters and constraints. 
            Changes to one part of the design automatically update related components, maintaining design 
            integrity and speeding up the iterative process.<br><br>
             CAD allows designers to create assemblies of parts, where individual components can be positioned,
              constrained, and assembled into larger mechanisms or structures. This is crucial for designing complex 
              systems such as machinery or vehicles.

            In day 3 we learn about how we make button. To understand the basic concepts of creating a button using HTML and CSS.
            Create a simple button using HTML and style it using CSS           
            Create a new HTML file named index.html.
            Inside the HTML file, set up the basic structure with the tags.
            Within the  tag, add a  element.Set the text of the button to something descriptive, such as "Click Me" or "Submit".
            Create a new CSS file named styles.cs Link the CSS file to your HTML document using the  tag within the section.
            Adjust the font size and Add padding and margins to create spacing around the button.
            Apply hover effects to make the button interactive (e.g., change color on hover).<br><br>
            Open the index.html file in a web browser to see how the button appea Test the button functionality by clicking on it to ensure it responds as expected
            Experiment with different CSS properties and values to further customize the appearance of the button.
             For example, you could try adding rounded corner shadows, or animations to enhance the visual appeal.<br>
            Ensure that your code is properly formatted and follows best practices for HTML and CSS. Feel free to explore online resources and documentation for additional guidance and inspiration.
            If you encounter any difficulties, don't hesitate to ask for assistance or clarification.<br><br>
            This assignment aims to provide hands-on experience with basic HTML and CSS concepts while focusing on the 
            creation and styling of a fundamental UI element the button. Students can build upon this foundation to develop
             more complex web interfaces in future assignments or project

          <p><h1> Day 4</h1></p>
          day 4 we learn how to create current time. To create a clock that displays the current time in a web browser, you can use HTML, CSS,
           and JavaScriptthe HTML file, a <div> element with the class clock is used to display the time.
             Inside this <div>, there is another <div> with the id time where the current time will be displayed.
            The CSS file styles the clock, setting the font size, text alignment, and margin to make it visually appealing.<br>
            
            In the JavaScript file, the updateTime() function is defined. This function gets the
             current time using new Date() and formats it into hours, minutes, and seconds. Then, it updates the
             text content of the time element with the formatted time string.<br>
            
            setInterval(updateTime, 1000) is used to call the updateTime() function every second, ensuring that the displayed time 
            is always up-to-date.
            Finally, the updateTime() function is called once immediately to display the current time when the page loads.
            You can further customize the appearance of the clock and add additional features as needed.
