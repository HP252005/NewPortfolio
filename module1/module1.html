                Attributes are always specified in the start tag and are written as name-value pairs.It's essential to write valid HTML to ensure proper rendering across different browsers.
                Online validators can be used to check HTML validity.<br><br>
                HTML comments are used to add notes or annotations within the HTML code. They start with  
                Comments are ignored by web browsers and are primarily used for documentation purposes or temporarily disabling code.<br>

                 These are some additional aspects of HTML that you can explore to enhance your understanding and proficiency
                 in web development. Experimenting with these features and practicing regularly will help you become proficient in HTML coding.</h3>

          <p><h1> Day 4</h1></p>
          day 4 we learn how to create current time. To create a clock that displays the current time in a web browser, you can use HTML, CSS,
           and JavaScriptthe HTML file, a <div> element with the class clock is used to display the time.
             Inside this <div>, there is another <div> with the id time where the current time will be displayed.
            The CSS file styles the clock, setting the font size, text alignment, and margin to make it visually appealing.<br>
            
            In the JavaScript file, the updateTime() function is defined. This function gets the
             current time using new Date() and formats it into hours, minutes, and seconds. Then, it updates the
             text content of the time element with the formatted time string.<br>
            
            setInterval(updateTime, 1000) is used to call the updateTime() function every second, ensuring that the displayed time 
            is always up-to-date.
            Finally, the updateTime() function is called once immediately to display the current time when the page loads.
            You can further customize the appearance of the clock and add additional features as needed.
