        <h3>CAD or Computer-Aided Design, is a technology that utilizes software to create, modify, 
            analyze, or optimize designs for various industries such as engineering, architecture, 
            automotive, aerospace, and more. CAD software often supports parametric modeling, where 
            designs are created using parameters and constraints. 
            Changes to one part of the design automatically update related components, maintaining design 
            integrity and speeding up the iterative process.<br><br>
             CAD allows designers to create assemblies of parts, where individual components can be positioned,
              constrained, and assembled into larger mechanisms or structures. This is crucial for designing complex 
              systems such as machinery or vehicles. </h3>

                 <h3>CAD stands for Computer-Aided Design. It's a crucial technology used in various industries
                   for creating, modifying, analyzing, and optimizing designs. CAD software allows designers and engineers 
                   to create precise 2D and 3D models of products or structures, facilitating visualization, simulation, and
                    documentation throughout the design process.<br>
                  In fields like architecture, engineering, manufacturing, and construction, 
                  CAD plays a vital role in speeding up design cycles, improving accuracy, and 
                  reducing costs. It enables collaborative work, as multiple team members can work on
                   the same design simultaneously, regardless of their physical location.<br><br>
